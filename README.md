# Independent Projects

This is  repository for my independent projects, i.e. tasks I have completed or am working on outside of work or school and just based of off personal interest.

Some things in this repository include:

* Coding algorithms from scratch either individually or by following guides 
* Coding functional programming practice problems from CodeChef  
* Individual data science projects 
* Coding exercises to bolster my skills, especially in practices I do not frequently use
* Creating explanations for algorithms and/or coding for myself and to share with others

If any of these files are of any interest to you or you feel may help, do not hestitate to fork the repository. Thank you and good luck!
